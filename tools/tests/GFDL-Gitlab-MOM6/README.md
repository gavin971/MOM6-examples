## Scripts used in gitlab pipeline testing MOM6 commits against the head of MOM6-examples

- These scripts are not for general consumption - they are mostly written in gmake so good luck figuring out how they work! :)
  But seriously they are written for a particular sequence of tests assuming a specific setup and so they really will not be much use for general application.
- These tests are not automatically triggered. Tests need to be manually instigated by pushing branches to gitlab.
